        <h3> Bio </h3>
        <p> I've been working in design since 2010 but 8 years later I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of where I want to be and what I want to become. In the sense that, I recognize the need to evolve and to pursue different paths in this widely misunderstood job, and everyday I aspire to do that.</p>
